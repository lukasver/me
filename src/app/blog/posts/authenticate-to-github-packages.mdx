## Authenticating to Github NPM Private Repository

A package is a piece of code that is aimed to be reused in different
applications/repos. Normally, JS packages are published in the NPM registry
(Node Package Manager) so developers can find, inspect, and use other people's
packages. This is cool if you want a public package to be published; however, if
you want it to be private, NPM offers a paid solution. There are other ways to
reuse code in other projects without having to copy/paste and maintain code in
different places (NOT COOL at all!), which are: **Git submodules** and **NPM
workspaces**. Both have slightly different use cases and implementations with
their pros and cons.

In this post, i've chosen to explore
[Github packages](https://github.com/features/packages) due to its simplicity
to integrate with Github ACtions workflows. But how does this work?

Let's say you have published a private, reusable package in your **acme** organization with
types and utils that need to be reused in different repositories:
**@acme/commons**. To use this package,
you would simply need to run `npm install @acme/commons` in your console like you
would install any other public package. However, there is a catch. Since the
package is hosted inside Github's private NPM repository, we need to be an
authenticated and authorized user from the **acme** organization (scope).

### Local development

Ok, now you would like you and your team to be able to install your organization
package locally like you would do with any npm package.
how can you do so? Follow these steps:

1. Go to your personal [Github account](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   settings page and create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with only the
   `packages: read` scope and desired expiration.
2. Create a `.npmrc` file in the root of your local repository (This file should
   not be pushed to the remote Github repo, so should be added to .gitignore).
3. Put the following content inside the file:

```
 @acme:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<REPLACE WITH YOUR PAT TOKEN FROM STEP 1>
```

4. Run `npm install @acme/commons`, and voil√†!

### Authenticate on Github Actions (CI)

The previous approach should work for your local development, but if you cannot
push the `.npmrc` file to the source code, how can you authorize the different
build runners to allow downloading this package? Well, while there can be
several different approaches to do this, we have added the complexity of creating
builds from Github Actions (CI/CD) using Docker to generate the images that will
later be used to run the apps. This means that we need to authenticate the
Docker build process for the private NPM registry, and we do this by using the
`GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable that is exposed into the Github Actions
runner instead of your own PAT. Be careful not to expose the token in this
process, so we should do this in a safe way.

1. The package should explicitly
   [authorize](https://github.com/orgs/acme/packages/npm/types/settings)
   other repositories that will be accessing it via Github Actions.
2. Then we need to add `packages: read` permission in the workflow to request a
   GITHUB_TOKEN with the right permission to install the package & add a new
   `registry-url` setting into the node setup step.
3. After that, we need to feed the `.npmrc` file or `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the
   Dockerfile. Depending on the approach taken, the Dockerfile should be amended
   accordingly; here is an example:

```yml
# workflow.yml

name: Build & Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [stage]
jobs:
  build-stage:
    permissions:
      contents: "read"
      packages: "read" ## <--- This is important
      id-token: "write"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22.3.0
          registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com/ ## <--- This is important

{... other steps ...}

# Create the .npmrc file with the token in the runner to feed it directly to the Dockerfile
      - name: Create .npmrc file
        run: |
          echo '@acme:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com' > .npmrc
          echo '//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}' >> .npmrc

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          push: true
          tags: "europe-north1-docker.pkg.dev/<GCP_PROJECT_ID>/<CONTAINER_FOLDER>/stage:latest"
          file: "./Dockerfile"
          secret-files: |
            "npmrc=${{ github.workspace }}/.npmrc" ## <-- This passes the file as a secret-file to be used inside the dockerfile as secret

```

4. Lastly, amend the Dockerfile to pick this .npmrc and set it as the default
   authentication to be used inside the container during the build process.
   Apparently, the secret needs to be passed inline with the `npm ci/install`
   command; otherwise, Docker uses the default runner ü´†.

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:20.3.0-alpine AS base
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
COPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* bun.lockb* ./
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=npmrc,target=/root/.npmrc npm ci --omit=dev ## <--- by overwriting the .npmrc in the /root/ folder, docker uses our new .npmrc data

```

And that's it; your private package should be installed correctly, and the build
should succeed now!
